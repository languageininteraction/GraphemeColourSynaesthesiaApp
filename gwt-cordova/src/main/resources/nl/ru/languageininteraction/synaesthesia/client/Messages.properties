aboutScreenTextAbody=<p>SynQuiz is an app that contains four playful tests for synaesthesia. <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''http://www.mpi.nl/synaesthesia'',''_system''); return false;">Synaesthesia</a> is a neurodevelopmental trait estimated to occur in about 4% of the general human population. For people with synaesthesia two or more senses appear to be interconnected; for example a synaesthete perceives certain concepts, such as letters, numbers, days of the week, or months of the year as inherently coloured. Many synaesthetes are not aware that their perceptions are unusual and are often surprised to find out that others do not think of letters, numbers, or weekdays in colours.</p><p>SynQuiz tests this type of synaesthesia, frequently referred to as grapheme-colour synaesthesia. The first three short quizzes are designed to give you (the user) a taste of what synaesthesia might be like and find out whether you might be experiencing it yourself. The Letters/Numbers-full test test gives an indication whether your type of synaesthesia is suitable for the ongoing genetic studies. If so, we might invite you to provide a small sample of saliva, from which we can obtain your DNA.</p>

aboutScreenTextBheading=<h3>Synaesthesia research</h3>
aboutScreenTextBbody=<p>SynQuiz is based on the <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''http://www.mpi.nl/synaesthesia'',''_system''); return false;">decoding the genetics of synaesthesia research programme</a> in the Language and Genetics Department at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. synaesthesia@mpi.nl</p><a href="#" onclick="window.open(''http://www.mpi.nl/synaesthesia'',''_system''); return false;"><img src="images/MPI-logo.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a><p>Previous research has shown that synaesthesia runs in families, but very little is known about which genes are responsible for building the structural and functional features in brains that are capable of synaesthetic experiences. We study the genetics of synaesthesia to uncover how this intriguing trait arises, but also to learn about neural connectivity in the developing human brain that is relevant to sensory processing, cognition, and language.</p>
aboutScreenTextCheading=<h3>Language in Interaction project</h3>
aboutScreenTextCbody=<p>SynQuiz was developed within the research consortium <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''http://www.languageininteraction.nl'',''_system''); return false;">Language in Interaction</a>, which aims to explain variation and similarities in languages as well as in linguistic skills. The consortium aims to gain understanding of how such a large range of (cultural) differences have arisen from a biological basis that is common to all people.</p><p>The research program examines human language from the level of genetics to interactions between conversational partners, addressing a diverse range of topics such as: brain structure and function, language development, evolution, multilingualism, speech production and comprehension, nonverbal behaviour, meaning and context, and the interplay of language with other cognitive systems (e.g. memory).</p>
aboutScreenTextDheading=<h3>More language apps</h3>
aboutScreenTextDbody=<p>The research results of Language in Interaction are translated into applications for society in areas such as education and health. Currently a range of <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''http://www.languageininteraction.nl/apps.html'',''_system''); return false;">language apps</a> are developed, including games.</p>
